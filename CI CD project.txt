1) Introduction:
	Developers writing the code and pushed into the git repository,
whenever code is available in git jenkins pull the code and do the build,
once build is completed it generates artifacts. Artifact should depoly in Docker container or Kubernetes cluster. 
To deploy target environment ansible is came into the picture to deploy the application

2) Setup ci-cd with jenkins,git, maven and tomcat
	setup jenkins
	run a test job
	setup & configure maven and git
	set tomcat server
	install plugins
	integrate git maven in jenkins job
	run ci cd job
		git github jekins ec2(artifactory)

	Docker:
	setting up docker environment
	managing docker with ansible
	docker hub repository
	docker file
	run job

	Integration with ansible:
	setting up ansible environment
	intgrating ansible with jenkins
	writing a ansible playbook to deploy on container
	run job
		git github jekins ansible docker

	Kubernes:
	setting up kubernetes environment
	writing deployment and service files
	run a job
		git github jekins ansible docker Kubernetess

3) What is CI & CD
	CI: Developers push the code into souce code management systems, once code is available in scm, then Jenkins could identify code and pull the code automatically and run build and unit test at the end of successfull continous integration process, we will get artifacts. 
	Deploying these artifacts in target environement(staging-run integration test, load test, performance test, funtional) we call it as a Continuous delivery, if build is stable then going to deploy in production environment with manual manner
	whereas continous deployment build is going deploy from staging to production environment as automatic manner is called contious deployment
